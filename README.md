[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f0153ed6b07340bda3c04d6f05df6e8c)](https://app.codacy.com/app/usgs_wma_dev/nldi-services?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ACWI-SSWD/nldi-services&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ACWI-SSWD/nldi-services.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ACWI-SSWD/nldi-services)

## Public API
The services are accessed via an http GET request. All navigation output is generated as GeoJSON ("application/vnd.geo+json")

### The root is {host}/nldi.
Both a test and a production are exposed to the public:
__https://labs-beta.waterdata.usgs.gov/nldi/linked_data__ is the test root.
__https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/nldi/linked_data__ is the production root.
This endpoint will give you the valid dataSource names for the other endpoints. There is also a health check at /about/health and version information at /about/info.

### Display Up/Down Stream Flow Lines
/{featureSource}/{featureSourceId}/navigate/{navigationMode} where:
  * __{featureSource}__ identifies the source used to start navigation:
  * __comid__ start the navigation from an NHDPlus comid
  * any of the network linked feature sources (listed at /)
  * __{featureSourceId}__ the NHDPlus comid or feature from which to start the navigation
  * __{navigationMode}__ is the direction and type of navigation:
  * __DD__ is __D__ownstream navigation with __D__iversions
  * __DM__ is __D__ownstream navigation on the __M__ain channel
  * __PP__ is __P__oint to __P__oint navigation (the __stopComid__ query parameter is required and must be downstream of the __{comid}__)
  * __UM__ is __U__pstream navigation on the __M__ain channel
  * __UT__ is __U__pstream navigation including all __T__ributaries

### Display Up/Down Stream Events
/{featureSource}/{featureSourceId}/navigate/{navigationMode}/{dataSource} where:
  * __{featureSource}__ identifies the source used to start navigation  (same values as for Flow Lines)
  * __{featureSourceId}__ the NHDPlus comid or other feature from which to start the navigation
  * __{navigationMode}__ is the direction and type of navigation (same values as for Flow Lines)
  * __{dataSource}__ is the abbreviation of the data source from which events should be shown

### Query Parameters
Both endpoints accept the same query parameters to further refine/restrict the navigation being requested
  * __distance={dist}__ limit the navigation to __{dist}__ kilometers from the starting point
  * __stopComid={stopid}__ for use with __PP__ navigation between the __{featureSourceId}__ and __{stopid}__
  * (only applicable to NHDPlus comid navigation and the __{stopid}__ must be downstream of the __{featureSourceId}__)

## Development
This is a Spring Batch/Boot project. All of the normal caveats relating to a Spring Batch/Boot application apply.

### Dependencies
This application utilizes a PostgreSQL database.
[nldi-db](https://github.com/ACWI-SSWD/nldi-db) contains everything you need to set up a development database environment. It includes data for the Yahara River in Wisconsin.

### Environment variables
To run the project you will need to create the file application.yml in the project's root directory and add the following:
```yaml
nldiDbHost: hostNameOfDatabase
nldiDbPort: portNumberForDatabase
nldiDbUsername: dbUserName
nldiDbPassword: dbPassword

nldiProtocol: http
nldiHost: owi-test.usgs.gov:8080
nldiPath: /test-url

serverContextPath: /nldi
springFrameworkLogLevel: INFO
serverPort: 8080

spring.security.user.password: changeMe
```

### Testing
This project contains JUnit tests. Maven can be used to run them (in addition to the capabilities of your IDE).

To run the unit tests of the application use:

```shell
mvn package
```

To additionally start up a Docker database and run the integration tests of the application use:

```shell
mvn verify -DTESTING_DATABASE_PORT=5445 -DTESTING_DATABASE_ADDRESS=localhost -DTESTING_DATABASE_NETWORK=nldiServices
```
